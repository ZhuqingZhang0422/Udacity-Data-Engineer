# Data Modeling with Postgres

## **Background**
A startup called <b>Sparkify</b> want to analyze the data they have been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The aim is to create a Postgres Database Schema and ETL pipeline to optimize queries for song play analysis.


## **Song Dataset**
Songs dataset is a subset of [Million Song Dataset]
<br>
As a example
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

## **Log Dataset**
Logs dataset is generated by [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim).
<br>
As a example
```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```

## Schema
#### Fact Table 
**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
```
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
```
#### Dimension Tables
**users**  - users in the app
```
user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
```
**songs**  - songs in music database
```
song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
```
**artists**  - artists in music database
```
artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
```
**time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
```
start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
```

## How to run

Run the drive program ```main.py``` as below.
```
python main.py
``` 

The ```create_tables.py``` and ```etl.py``` file can also be run independently as below:
```
python create_tables.py 
python etl.py 
```
